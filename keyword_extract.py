HMB443H1: Global Hidden Hunger will be offered this summer!

In this course, you will discuss global food insecurity and come up with tangible ways to address equity in health and access to food, poverty and metabolic diseases that relate to deficiencies and the 'hidden hunger' that leads to deterioration of health across populations. Hidden Hunger is preventable and this course begins to practically address these issues and is really for anyone who is interested in the concepts of health access, inequity and food security.
This course also features a virtual service learning component with a partner in British Columbia.

Prerequisites: 12 FCE complete, At least 0.5 HMB 300-Level Courses.
