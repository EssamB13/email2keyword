    " From March 11-13th, this conference will bring together professional, graduate, and undergraduate students to discuss pertinent issues related to this yearâ€™s theme: The Future of Healthcare Accessibility. While healthcare accessibility has always been an important issue, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the damage that can be caused when health equities and human rights are not respected. We hope to discuss the current issues and questions surrounding healthcare accessibility, as well as future solutions, considerations and innovations. Our event will include speakers, breakout sessions, NGO and research fairs. For more details about the conference program and for registration details, visit our website and/or Facebook page. \n",
